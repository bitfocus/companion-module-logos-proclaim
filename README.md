## Known issues:

- Proclaim currently requires the authentication header name to be capitalized as ProclaimAuthToken - there is
  code in sendAppCommand() to force this capitalization, which can be removed once Proclaim updates this.
- Proclaim currently returns API responses with the text/html content-type rather than text/plain and text/json
  as appropriate. I think this may be why in getAuthToken() I had to use Got's .text() method rather than .json(),
  and manually strip the byte order marker, to be able to parse the response containing the authentication token.
